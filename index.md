## Theme and Goals

Today, the development of software and systems is typically done in a heterogenous environment. Every stage of the development process and workflow involves dedicated tools including requirement management and design solutions, source code management and quality assurance (testing), whereas each tool creates its own development artifacts. This scattered and distributed landscape poses new challenges to satisfy stakeholders needs for making rational decisions, which requires access to all of the artifact sources.

Recent advances in tooling provide basic support to aggregate the massive amount of data from all these tools. However, there is still no efficient method to operationalize the collected information consisting of domain documents, requirements, safety analysis, design, code, test cases, simulations, version control data, fault logs, model checkers, project plans and so on. When combined, e.g. through means of software analytics, this data can deliver precise answers to questions stakeholders and business analysts demand and support the decision-making process. Advances in machine learning, especially in the field of (deep) neural networks, allow to process the data and provide the foundation to develop intelligent systems on top of it.

Next to further improving the data collection process (repository mining), current research activities focus on efficient methods to trace between the artifacts, formulate queries to access the data, and reporting techniques to present retrieved results. Novel machine learning algorithms offer new ways to aggregate and process artifact data providing insights and deeper understanding when analyzing requirements.

**Goal** The purpose of the workshop is to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners to share and exchange ideas and experiences about intelligent data science in software projects. Researchers will explain their ideas how to solve key aspects in the existing challenges. On the other hand, practitioners can provide feedback on the ideas and describe how they currently process business data and gather information in their day to day work. The dialog offers a great opportunity to develop objectives for next generation methods and systems.
